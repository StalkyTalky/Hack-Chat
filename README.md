# HackChat

A very cool chat project‚Ñ¢.

## Planned Features List:

### IAN-C currency!

It stands for 'Irritating and nonfunctional currency'. Very catchy, isn't it?

It's currency that you can 'earn' by doing things such as:
Chatting,
Chatting

#### and last but not least...

chatting.

Yeah, it's very clear I haven't worked out the details... but I will, soon‚Ñ¢.

### Radio üìª command

A command that will highlight your message in exchange for IAN-C currency (I love that name so much).

### An 'upvote' üëç system

A system that allows you to (via the pre-existing 'commands' feature) upvote someone. (Maybe this can be used for IAN-C?)

### Long-term storage of data

Currently, the servers store no data, which makes IAN-C currency IMPOSSIBLE! :(
